		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>We're passionate about stopping cyber criminals, one small business at a time.  We use a proprietary, bleeding edge software system that uses artificial intelligence to simulate a hacking event on your network similar to what the criminals do.</p>
		<p>There are literally thousands of possible vulnerabilities found on some networks yielding an overwhelming pile of data that largely gets discarded upon receipt.  The Inspector provides a prioritized list of things that should be fixed to provide an improved security posture. </p>
		<p>Cyber criminals are constantly evolving so we update our attack vectors regularly to help ensure the best and latest information. </p>
		<p>It's taken more than a decade and some serious hands on experience to achieve what our creator has, including on-site service to Department of Defense contractors in the Middle East.</p>
